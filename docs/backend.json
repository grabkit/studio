    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support a social media application similar to a threads app, focusing on user posts. It prioritizes authorization independence by using path-based ownership for posts ( `/users/{userId}/posts/{postId}`), eliminating the need for `get()` calls in security rules and enabling atomic operations. This structure inherently supports the QAPs: listing posts is secured by path-based ownership, limiting access to posts to authorized users (primarily the owner). Each user has their own collection of posts, ensuring secure `list` operations based on the user ID. The structure also supports efficient querying and retrieval of posts for a specific user. The system avoids custom claims (DBAC) and relies on Firebase Auth's `uid` for access control."
